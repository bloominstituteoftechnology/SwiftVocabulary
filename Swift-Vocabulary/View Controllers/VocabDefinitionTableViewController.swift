Typically, a program consists of instruction s that tell the computer what to do and data that the program uses when it is running."),
                                      MyVocabulary(name: "Constant", definition: "a constant is a value that cannot be altered by the program during normal execution, i.e., the value is constant. ... This is contrasted with a variable, which is an identifier with a value that can be changed during normal execution, i.e., the value is variable."),
                                      MyVocabulary(name: "Function", definition: "a named section of a program that performs a specific task. In this sense, a function is a type of procedure or routine. Some programming languages make a distinction between a function, which returns a value, and a procedure, which performs some operation but does not return a value."),
                                      MyVocabulary(name: "Enum", definition: "An enumeration defines a common type for a group of related values and enables you to work with those values in a type-safe way within your code."),
                                      MyVocabulary(name: "Struct", definition: "structures are general-purpose, flexible constructs that become the building blocks of your program's code. ... In simple terms, a struct is like a custom data type which provides storage of data using properties with extended functionality using methods."),
